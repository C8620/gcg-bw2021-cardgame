This is a PHP implementation of the card-based game that was played on the 2021 Bilibili World at the station of Double Life World.

Overall, this game is stateless - no database is needed for configuration, and making cheating very easy for someone knowing what they are doing.

This was finished on 2022 just a few days after bw2021 and was made available on gcg.moe website. Due to server cost considerations, I am no longer hosting this and publishing this on GitHub for anyone who wishes to feel some kind of deja vu.

Due the the nature that I am 100% not mature when writing this piece of code, it is expected to be quite hard to read, with a lot of bad practices that I would not preform in 2023.

If any question found, please kindly open an issue. If you found out a bug and wishes to improve, please fork and then submit a pull request.
